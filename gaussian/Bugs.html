<h5>Fourier basis</h5> 

This basis does not work at all. Not even with empirical coefficients computed from a very
large number of data points. Why not???
Printing shows the basis functions are OK.
<p>
Note: the Fourier basis is an example where the kernel matrix (K(s_i,s_j))_{0<=i,j<=n can fail
to be positive semidefinite even though N>=n.
This happens in particular if the s_j form an equidistant partition of [-1,+1].
For N=n the kernel matrix is integer valued. Find out why.
<p>
Clearly equidistant points are not good.
Use random points instead.
To no avail the Fourier basis NEVER WORKS.
<p>
The Legendre basis does work flawlessly on smooth functions but has problems with nonsomooth functions.
See expansions/Abs and expansion/f_3.
Note in particular how detrimental it is to include the data point t=0 at the corner.
The problems persist even under NOISY data.
Somehow the basis KNOWS that the underlying function is not smooth despite the noise in
the data.

<h5>Matrix.h</h5>
<p>
<code>Matrix& operator =(const Matrix& B){ if(this=&B) return *this; .......}</code>
<p>
There should be two equality signs.  This is not yet fixed in <code>martingale</code>.
Post the bug on the project website.


<h3>6-17-04</h3>

Empirical regression with Fourier basis with very large numer of data points shows systematic error.
See file results/Fourier-601-emp.eps (empirical with 601 data points).
Check normalization.

<code>Programs.h: interactiveRegression()</code> works.
<code>Programs.h: regressionPlots():</code> does not work, directories not allocated correctly, plots akward.
<code>Programs.h: plotTest():</code> works.


<h3>6-18-04</h3>

<code>RegressionPlots::regressionPlots():</code> works but cannot be used on Fourier basis as N is set to N=1.6*n 
and this is not enough to make the kernel matrix positive definite in each case. As the program exits
from the Cholesky decomposition the plots are not saved.
Implement choice to set N=k*n, with k chosen by user.
<p>
<code>Plot.h: PSPlot</code> Implement a method that allows us to plot the data points.
